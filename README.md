In this Hackathon, I was provided with a dataset containing problems and solutions collected from early entrepreneurs. My task is to build an AI platform to differentiate between spam solutions and genuine ones. This platform aims to save angel investors' time by filtering out only the good solutions.

Initially, I write a problem from the dataset, and even if there are spelling mistakes, fuzzywuzzy helps in identifying the correct problem and solution. Then, I provide the solution to ChatGPT to summarize. Next, I ask ChatGPT to generate its version of the solution. After summarizing both solutions, I compare them. If the similarity score is not high enough, indicating significant differences, the early entrepreneur's solution is considered spam and excluded from angel investors' review.
