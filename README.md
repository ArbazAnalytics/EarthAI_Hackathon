We have been provided with the dataset that contains problem and its solution. The user will enter its problem and with the help of fuzzywuzzy, the algorithm will find the most similar problem in the dataset. If the similarity score is more than 60% then it will retrieve the corresponding solution from the dataset. We have used openAI to generate the more detailed solution from chatgpt. After that we have used ‘Hugging Face’ to generate the summaries of both the solution and with the help of fuzzywuzzy we have calculated the similarity scores of both the summaries.
